//! The pending read (task B1): a read's or capture's begin leaves the map's promise in one slot
//! (its own `RefCell`, separate from the `Owned` object); `dhdr_web_pending()`, a wasm-bindgen
//! export, hands it to the reactor's Suspending `web_gpu_await()` import, so Rust is never on the
//! stack while the reactor is suspended.
//!
//! The browser's split read (plan 1.4, finding 085 S4):
//!
//! 1. C calls a begin (`dhdr_exact_read_begin`, `dhdr_exact_capture_begin`). It submits and maps
//!    through `map_read`, which opens the slot (a new promise) and starts `map_async`; the begin
//!    returns at once.
//! 2. C calls its own Suspending import `web_gpu_await()`; JS implements it as
//!    `new WebAssembly.Suspending(() => R.dhdr_web_pending())`. The promising root suspends; the
//!    event loop runs; the map's callback (the begin's own status update first) settles the
//!    promise with 1 (mapped) or 0 (failed). The JSPI resumes C with that number.
//! 3. C calls the finish, which reads the map's status the begin kept and copies.
//!
//! The promise always settles and is never rejected: a map that fails settles 0, device loss
//! settles 0 (`lost`), and a begin that opens a new wait while an older one is still unsettled
//! settles the older one 0 first. With nothing in flight (a begin that had nothing to map), the
//! promise is an already resolved 1. Only the map callback, the device-lost callback and the
//! exports touch the slot, each on the worker's one thread and never while another holds it.
