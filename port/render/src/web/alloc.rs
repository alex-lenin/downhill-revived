//! The browser module's allocator (task B1): a bounded `#[global_allocator]` over
//! `[__heap_base, 0x69000000)` in the core's imported memory, trapping on exhaustion without
//! touching anything outside that window (finding 085, S4; the G1 memory window).
//!
//! The renderer shares the core's one memory (`--import-memory`). Its linker window is data from
//! 0x60000000 (`--global-base`), a 1 MiB stack above it (`--no-stack-first`), then the heap up to
//! the module's own `--initial-memory` (0x69000000). Everything outside belongs to the core and the
//! C reactor. std's default wasm allocator grows the memory and would take pages above the core's
//! initial size, so this one never calls `memory.grow`: it hands out only the window, and when the
//! window is full it logs one line and returns null, so std's alloc-error path aborts (an
//! `unreachable` trap) before any byte outside is touched.
//!
//! Design: small requests (up to 256 bytes, alignment up to 16) come from 16 size classes of 16
//! bytes each, kept on per-class free lists (LIFO, never merged back: they are reused by the same
//! sizes, which is what wgpu's and wasm-bindgen's small objects do). Everything else is first fit
//! over one address-ordered free list of 16-byte-aligned spans, split on allocation and coalesced
//! with both neighbours on free. A large block keeps a 16-byte header just below the pointer it
//! returns: the span's start and length (alignment above 16 may leave a gap in front, which the
//! header lets free give back). `dealloc` gets the layout from std, so small blocks need no header.
//!
//! wasm32 without the atomics feature is single-threaded (the browser module's worker); the
//! state is in `Cell`s. A build with atomics is refused at compile time.
#[cfg(target_feature = "atomics")]
