//! What every export enters first: the MXCSR guard, the export's name for the panic hook,
//! `Owned<T>` (one entry at a time per object) and the fatal path.
//!
//! **MXCSR.** The EE thread calls with `0xFFC0` (round toward zero, FTZ, DAZ). naga folds WGSL
//! constants with the host's floating point, and FXC parses the HLSL text naga writes the same way,
//! so a pipeline built under the caller's mode gets constants one ulp off (finding 085, S3; the
//! 244df66db class). `Guard::enter` saves MXCSR, sets IEEE (`ieee(csr)`: round to nearest, no FTZ,
//! no DAZ, every exception masked, flags clear) and restores the caller's value on drop, on every
//! return path. The `no-fp-guard` feature keeps the caller's MXCSR: the negative control of
//! `tests/device_smoke.rs`'s guard tests, which rustgs refuses outside its selftest. On aarch64
//! (Android) the same guard holds FPCR instead (`ieee_fpcr`: the EE thread's round toward zero and
//! flush to zero off). On wasm there is no control register and the guard only names the export.
//!
//! **Fatal path.** A panic is logged through `host::log` (naming the export), then the
//! `panic = "abort"` profile ends the process. An uncaptured device error is logged, then the
//! process aborts (`install_error_handler`), as the C path's on_error does: a validation error
//! means a wrong picture, never carry on. Out of memory on Windows ends with an error box and exit
//! code 1 instead (`out_of_memory`).
