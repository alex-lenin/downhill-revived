//! Discord Rich Presence (finding 106): what the player is doing, on their Discord profile.
//!
//! The game core works out the state (port/hle/presence.c) and sends it through
//! `host_service_presence` when it changes; port/hle/host.c hands it here (`c.rs`). A thread of its
//! own (`worker.rs`) talks to Discord's local IPC through the discord-rich-presence crate: a named
//! pipe on Windows, a Unix socket on macOS and Linux. No Discord SDK. Discord running or not, the
//! player sees nothing of it but their profile: no error box, one log line at most while Discord
//! isn't there, a quiet retry every 30 s.
//!
//! This file is the part without Discord: the state, the two lines and the elapsed time Discord
//! shows for it (`payload`), and the pacing (`Pacer`: only a change is sent, at most one update per
//! 15 s, which is about what Discord allows).
